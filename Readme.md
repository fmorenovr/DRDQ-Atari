## Deep reinforcement Learning for Atari

In this work, we try to improve the CNN worked with DQN proposed by Deep Mind.

This work is based on [gsurma](https://github.com/gsurma/atari) example.  
We add DRQN and GE Heuristics.

We Also use [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#atari)

We Implement Deep Recurrent double Q-Learning for Atari.
